# gpm_visualizer
Visualizing and analyzing the precipitation data downloaded from NASA GPM data files.

This program is meant for visualizing and analyzing the precipitation data downloaded from NASA GPM data files.
The expected functionalies are:
  * Downloading precipitation data (early, late, and final runs) to local drive.
  * Display world map using OpenStreetMaps
  * Openning shapefiles, loading and ploting borders of countries or selected regions on the map.
  * Calculating the locations of the (virtual) stations where the satellite do precipitation measurment within the loaded map.
  * Reading precipitation data from NASA files for the loaded map and then visualizing and displaying them.
  * Calculating the precipitation sumation for specific area and specific period.
  * Calculating the maximum precipitation for specific number of hours during a specific year.
  * Showing data in map view (Heat Map) or table view.
  * Calculating precipitation data for any location by interpolating formula using the surrounding preceipitation data.
  * Saving results in csv format.

#GPM Mission Concept
The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is an international network of satellites that provide next-generation global observations of rain and snow. Building upon the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the GPM concept centers on the deployment of a “Core Observatory” satellite carrying an advanced radar / radiometer system to measure precipitation from space and serve as a reference standard to unify precipitation measurements from a constellation of research and operational satellites. Through improved measurements of precipitation globally, the GPM mission is helping to advance our understanding of Earth's water and energy cycles, improve forecasting of extreme events that cause natural hazards and disasters, and extend current capabilities in using accurate and timely information of precipitation to directly benefit society. GPM, initiated by NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) as a global successor to TRMM, comprises a consortium of international space agencies, including the Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and others.

The GPM Core Observatory launched on February 27th, 2014 at 1:37pm EST from Tanegashima Space Center, Japan. Learn more about the launch.
