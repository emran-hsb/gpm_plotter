# gpm_visualizer
Visualizing and analyzing the precipitation data downloaded from NASA GPM data files.

This program is meant for visualizing and analyzing the precipitation data downloaded from NASA GPM data files.
The expected functionalies are:
  * Downloading precipitation data (early, late, and final runs) to local drive.
  * Display world map using OpenStreetMaps
  * Openning shapefiles, loading and ploting borders of countries or selected regions on the map.
  * Calculating the locations of the (virtual) stations where the satellite do precipitation measurment within the loaded map.
  * Reading precipitation data from NASA files for the loaded map and then visualizing and displaying them.
  * Calculating the precipitation sumation for specific area and specific period.
  * Calculating the maximum precipitation for specific number of hours during a specific year.
  * Showing data in map view (Heat Map) or table view.
  * Calculating precipitation data for any location by interpolating formula using the surrounding preceipitation data.
  * Saving results in csv format.
